I am interested in developing machine intelligence. My work sits at the intersection of reinforcement learning and statistics, and focuses on how we can use statistical tools to improve generalization in reinforcement learning. My most recent paper, [Invariance Through Inference](https://openreview.net/forum?id=vXGcHthY6v), provides a good overview of this setting. For more thoughts on generalization, see also my recent papers on [planning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.12491.pdf) and [causal inference](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.07804.pdf).


Short Bio
======
I am a research assistant professor at [TTIC](https://www.ttic.edu/), an academic institute located on the campus of the University of Chicago. 
In 2018, I completed my PhD at UC Berkeley. My advisor was [Pieter Abbeel](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/). 
In 2016 and 2017, I was a research scientist at Open AI, where I was advised by Ilya Sutskever. 
I received a BA in mathematics from the University of Chicago, where I spent four wonderful years. 
During this time, I had the honor of working under 
[Paul Sally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Sally).

I am on the academic job market this year.
