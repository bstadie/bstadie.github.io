I am interested in developing algorithms that endow robots with human-like problem-solving abilities.
Most of my work falls under the umbrellas of [exploration](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.00814.pdf), [imitation learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01703), and [meta](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.01118.pdf) [learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.07804.pdf).


Short Bio
======
I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/), an AI research institute with strong ties to the University of Toronto. 
In 2018, I completed my PhD at UC Berkeley. My advisor was [Pieter Abbeel](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/). 
In 2016 and 2017, I was a research scientist at Open AI, where I was advised by Ilya Sutskever. 
I received a BA in mathematics from the University of Chicago, where I spent four wonderful years. 
During this time, I had the honor of working under 
[Paul Sally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Sally).
