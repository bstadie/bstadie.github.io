My primary research goal is to build machines that 
can solve problems as efficiently as humans. While machines are much more efficient 
than humans at well-defined rigid tasks, they typically falter on problems that require flexibility, 
adaptability, exploration, and generalization. 
I want to close this gap by creating algorithms that learn to 
iteratively generalize from past experience. 
Most of my work falls under the umbrellas of
[meta learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.01118.pdf), 
[exploration](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.00814.pdf), and 
[imitation learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01703).  

Short Bio
======
I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/),
where I work with [Jimmy Ba](https://jimmylba.github.io/). 
In 2018, I completed my PhD at UC Berkeley. My advisor was [Pieter Abbeel](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/). 
In 2016 and 2017, I was a research scientist at Open AI, where I was advised by Ilya Sutskever. 
I received a BA in mathematics from the University of Chicago, where I spent four wonderful years. 
During this time, I had the honor of working under 
[Paul Sally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Sally).
