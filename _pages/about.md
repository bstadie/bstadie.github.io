I am interested in developing machine intelligence. Towards this goal, I research reinforcement learning, high level planning, and robot learning. I have written about [planning in robotics](https://sites.google.com/view/latent-landmarks/), [goal conditioned reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.02832), [diffusion for shared autonomy](https://diffusion-for-shared-autonomy.github.io/), and [causal inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.07804). Most recently, I have been investigating the intersection of large [language models (LLMs) and physical task planning](https://wonderful-team-robotics.github.io/).

Short Bio
======


I am an assistant professor in the [Northwestern University Department of Statistics and Data Science](https://statistics.northwestern.edu/.).

Previously, I was a research assistant professor at [TTIC](https://www.ttic.edu/), an academic institute located on the campus of the University of Chicago. 
In 2018, I completed my PhD at UC Berkeley. My advisor was [Pieter Abbeel](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/). 
In 2016 and 2017, I was a research scientist at Open AI, where I was advised by [Ilya Sutskever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Sutskever). 
I received a BA in mathematics from the University of Chicago, where I spent four wonderful years. 
During this time, I had the honor of working under 
[Paul Sally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Sally).


My Google Scholar page can be found [here](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=lEV5F5kAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). 

My CV is [here](files/bstadie_cv.pdf).
