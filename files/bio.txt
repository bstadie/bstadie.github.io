Bradly Stadie is an Assistant Professor of Statistics and Data Science at Northwestern University. 
He received his PhD in Statistics from UC Berkeley in 2018 and has previously spent time as a researcher at Toyota Technological Institute of Chicago and Vector Institute in Toronto. 
From 2016-2018, Bradly was a research scientist at OpenAI, where he was a founding member of the reinforcement learning team. 
Bradlyâ€™s current research centers on foundational questions in reinforcement learning, asking how we can best train machine learning models from different types of feedback. 
This work draws surprising connections to a variety of fields, including causal inference, large language models, and graph search.
